- 2021-2022: Independently developed [**Clash of bits**](https://github.com/Butanium/clash-of-bits), a game that I plan to publish on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6587dcc2e3a07bd4696c16a3e63238b4a184)
- 2020: Small **Reinforcement learning** project on Unity with the *ml-agents* library
- 2020: [**War of Colonies**](https://github.com/Butanium/War-of-colonies): attempted to use genetic algorithms in Conway's Game of Life
- 2019-2021: **Genetic algorithms** for the travelling salesman problem with [**`Scratch`**](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/288141249), **`Unreal Engine`** and [**`Python`**](https://github.com/Butanium/Genetic_algorithm_for_TSP_python)
